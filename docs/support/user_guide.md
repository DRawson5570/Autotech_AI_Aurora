# Autotech AI User Guide

## Getting Started

Welcome to Autotech AI! This platform helps automotive technicians quickly find repair information, specifications, and technical data.

### Quick Start
1. Start a new chat (click + or press Ctrl+Shift+O)
2. Select a model with the tools you need (look for Mitchell or AutoDB in the model name)
3. Ask your question naturally, like "What's the oil capacity for a 2020 Honda Accord 1.5T?"

## Available Tools

### Mitchell Automotive Data
Professional repair data from ShopKeyPro covering most vehicles from 1990-present.

**What you can look up:**
- Fluid capacities (oil, coolant, transmission, brake, power steering)
- Torque specifications (lug nuts, brake calipers, engine components)
- Wiring diagrams (any electrical system)
- TSBs (Technical Service Bulletins)
- DTC codes (trouble code descriptions and diagnostic procedures)
- Reset procedures (oil life, TPMS, maintenance lights)
- ADAS calibration requirements
- Tire and wheel specifications

**Best practices:**
- Always include Year, Make, Model, and Engine
- Be specific: "front brake caliper bracket bolts" not just "brake torque"
- One question at a time gets better results

**Examples:**
- "Look up the transmission fluid capacity for a 2018 Ford F-150 3.5L EcoBoost"
- "Show me the starter wiring diagram for a 2019 Chevy Silverado 5.3L"
- "What's the spark plug torque for a 2017 Toyota Tacoma 3.5L?"
- "Find TSBs about AC problems on a 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee"

### AutoDB
Access to owner's manuals and maintenance guides.

**What you can look up:**
- Recommended maintenance schedules
- Owner's manual procedures
- Basic vehicle specifications
- Warning light meanings

## Billing & Tokens

### How It Works
- Your account has a token balance
- Each AI interaction uses tokens based on the model and response length
- Longer responses and larger models use more tokens

### Checking Your Balance
Settings > Account shows your current token balance

### Buying Tokens
In Settings > Account, select a token package and click "Buy Now"

### Cost-Effective Usage
- Be specific in your questions to avoid back-and-forth
- Save frequently-used info to your Knowledge base

---

## Saving Information

### Why Save?
Save useful specifications to your personal Knowledge base so you can reference them later without using tokens to look them up again.

### How to Save
After the AI provides useful information, you can:
1. Ask "save this to my knowledge base"
2. The AI will save a formatted document with the key information

### Accessing Saved Information
Go to Knowledge in the sidebar to see your saved documents.

## Models

### Choosing the Right Model
- **For vehicle lookups:** Use models with Mitchell or AutoDB tools enabled
- **For general questions:** Any model works
- **For coding/technical help:** Claude or GPT-4 models work well

### Important: Accuracy for Specific Values
AI models can "hallucinate" (make up) specific technical values like torque specs, fluid capacities, and measurements. **Never trust specific numbers from the AI's general knowledge.**

**For accurate specifications:**
- Use **Mitchell** (professional repair data) if you have access
- Use **AutoDB** for owner's manual information
- Enable **Web Search** to find manufacturer specs online

**When to trust AI responses:**
- General procedures, diagnostics, and related concepts ✓
- Explaining how systems work ✓
- Helping interpret error codes ✓
- **Specific torque values, capacities, gap settings — always verify** ⚠️

### Model Capabilities
Each model shows its enabled capabilities:
- Vision: Can analyze images
- File Upload: Can process uploaded documents
- Web Search: Can search the internet
- Tools: Has access to Mitchell, AutoDB, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### "The AI didn't find my vehicle"
- Check your spelling of make/model
- Try being more specific with the engine (e.g., "2.5L 4-cylinder" not just "4-cylinder")
- Some very old or rare vehicles may not be in the database

### "The AI keeps asking for clarification"
- Include all vehicle details upfront: Year, Make, Model, Engine
- Be specific about which component (front vs rear brakes, driver vs passenger, etc.)

### "I'm getting an error"
- Check your token balance in Settings > Account
- Try refreshing the page
- If it persists, start a new chat

### "Mitchell tools show as DISABLED"
- Contact your administrator to enable Mitchell access for your account
- Make sure you're using a model that has Mitchell tools configured

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific with vehicles** - "2019 Toyota Camry 2.5L 4-cylinder" works better than just "Camry"

2. **One question at a time** - Ask for oil capacity, get the answer, then ask about the filter

3. **Include context** - "What's the torque for the front brake caliper BRACKET bolts?" is better than "brake torque"

4. **Save what you use often** - If you work on the same vehicles frequently, save the specs

5. **Use natural language** - You don't need special commands, just ask like you'd ask a colleague
