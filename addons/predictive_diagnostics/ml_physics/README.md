# ML Physics Diagnostic Engine

This module implements the ML-based approach to physics-informed automotive diagnostics.

## Approach

Instead of hardcoding physics equations, we train a neural network to **learn** the physics
relationships from synthetic data generated by physics simulators.

## Key Concept

```
Physics Simulators → Synthetic Training Data → ML Model → Diagnostic Reasoning
```

The ML model learns to "think like the system itself" by being trained on millions of
scenarios where we know the ground truth (because we generated it from physics).

## Comparison to Deterministic Physics

| Deterministic (`../physics/`) | ML Physics (`./`) |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Explicit equations | Learned relationships |
| One system at a time | Unified multi-system model |
| Perfect explainability | Attention-based explanation |
| Manual fault encoding | Learns from synthetic data |

## Status

📋 **Specification complete** - See SPEC.md for full details
🔲 **Implementation not started**

## Prerequisites

The deterministic physics models in `../physics/` are required to generate training data.
