If the waveform shows a clean drop to ground and a sharp inductive spike, but the component doesn't move, the failure is likely mechanical. If the voltage never drops to ground, the control circuit or the ECM driver may be faulty.", "vehicle": null, "scan_data": null, "mitchell_data": null, "source": "user_chat", "quality_score": null}

If the pressure increases while the engine is running, combustion gases are likely entering the cooling jacket.\n2. **System Preservation:** Drain the cooling system and engine oil. Label all electrical connectors and vacuum lines to ensure correct reassembly.\n3. **Top-End Disassembly:** Remove the intake manifold, valve covers, and timing drive components. On the 3.7L engine, the timing chains must be properly marked or held to maintain engine timing.\n4. **Remove Cylinder Head:** Loosen the head bolts in the reverse order of the tightening sequence. Lift the head off and inspect for cracks or warping.\n5. **Surface Preparation:** Thoroughly clean the engine block and cylinder head surfaces. Do not use abrasive pads that can round off edges or leave debris in the oil/coolant passages. \n6. **Installation:** Position the new gasket (ensure it is dry and correctly oriented). Lower the head onto the block using guide pins if available.\n7. **Torque to Spec:** Use new head bolts (they are typically torque-to-yield) and follow the specific multi-stage torque and angle sequence found in your service data.\n8. **Reassembly:** Reinstall the timing chains, valve covers, and intake manifold. Refill fluids and perform a final leak test.\n\n**SPECS:**\n*   **Torque Specs:** The 3.7L engine requires a specific multi-step torque-plus-angle sequence; verify the exact degrees and inch-pound/foot-pound increments in your shop service manual.\n*   **Diagnostic Threshold:** During a pressure test, any significant drop in pressure or a visible increase in pressure while the engine is running indicates a leak.\n*   **Planarity:** Check the cylinder head for flatness; typically, anything over 0.002\"\u20130.004\" across the length of the head requires machining.\n\n**IMAGES:**\nNone available\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\nPerform a final cooling system pressure test after assembly to ensure no external leaks exist.

Ensure the engine is cool before attaching any test equipment to avoid severe burns from pressurized steam or coolant.\n2. **Attach Adapter:** Select the correct adapter for your vehicle's radiator filler neck or expansion tank (header tank) and connect the pressure tester pump.\n3. **Determine Test Pressure:** Look for the rated pressure stamped on the radiator cap or consult your service data. According to my verified sources, approximately 1 bar (about 14.5 psi) is a common standard, but you must verify the specific limit for your vehicle to avoid damaging components.\n4. **Pressurize the System:** Pump the tester until the gauge reaches the specified pressure. Do not exceed the pressure rating on the cap.\n5. **Inspect for External Leaks:** With the system under pressure, visually inspect all hoses, the radiator, the water pump, and heater core connections for drips or spraying coolant.\n6. **Perform the \"Running Test\" (Internal Leak Check):** Pressurize the system while cold, then start the engine. Observe the gauge; if the pressure increases rapidly as the engine runs, it indicates that combustion gases are leaking into the water jacket, likely due to a head gasket failure or a cracked head/block.\n7. **Monitor Pressure Drop:** With the engine off, the system should hold the applied pressure for several minutes. A steady drop in pressure without visible external leaks suggests an internal leak (e.g., into the oil gallery or combustion chamber).\n\n**SPECS:**\n*   **Normal System Pressure:** Approximately 1 bar is normal for many systems, though you must check the radiator cap or service data for the exact threshold.\n*   **Operating Temperature:** Typically well above 90\u00b0C (194\u00b0F) once the engine is at full temperature.\n*   **Pressure Drop:** Any significant drop in pressure during a static test indicates a leak that must be addressed.\n\n**IMAGES:**\nNone available\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\nAfter performing repairs, refill the system with the correct coolant mixture (typically a 50/50 mix). Re-run the pressure test to ensure the system now holds the specified pressure without dropping.
