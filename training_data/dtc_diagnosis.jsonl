The EVAP system's job is to capture fuel vapors from the fuel tank and prevent them from escaping into the atmosphere, routing them instead to the engine to be burned.  A \"small leak\" typically refers to a leak that's smaller than a certain threshold, but still enough to trigger the check engine light.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what that means:\n\n*   **Evaporative Emission Control (EVAP) System:** This system is critical for reducing air pollution by preventing gasoline vapors from escaping into the environment. It does this by:\n    *   **Capturing vapors:** Fuel vapors from the fuel tank are stored in an activated charcoal canister.\n    *   **Purging the vapors:** When the engine is running and conditions are right, the engine's computer opens a valve to allow the vapors to be drawn into the engine to be burned.\n*   **Small Leak:** This indicates a leak in the system that's detectable by the vehicle's onboard diagnostics. It could be caused by various issues, including:\n    *   **Loose or damaged fuel cap:** This is the most common cause.\n    *   **Cracked or disconnected hoses or tubes:** These can develop leaks over time due to wear, tear, or heat.\n    *   **Damaged EVAP canister or vent valve:** Components of the EVAP system can fail.\n    *   **Faulty purge valve:** This valve controls the flow of vapors from the canister to the engine.\n    *   **Cracked or damaged fuel tank:**  Less common, but possible.\n    *   **A worn or damaged fuel filler neck.**\n    *   **Vent solenoid problems.**\n    *   **Other EVAP system components.**\n\n**What to do if you get code P0442:**\n\n1.  **Check the Fuel Cap:** The first and easiest thing to check is the fuel cap. Make sure it's properly tightened (often a click or two), and inspect it for cracks or damage to the rubber seal. Sometimes, just tightening or replacing the fuel cap resolves the issue.\n2.  **Visual Inspection:** Look for any obvious signs of damage in the EVAP system, such as cracked hoses, loose connections, or damage to the canister or other components.\n3.  **Use a Scan Tool (or have a shop do it):** A scan tool can read the code, and often provides freeze frame data that can help identify when the code was triggered, and can often command tests of the EVAP system to isolate the leak.\n4.  **Professional Diagnosis:** If the problem isn't obvious, it's best to take the car to a qualified mechanic. They will have specialized tools and the expertise to diagnose the leak accurately, using methods like a smoke test to pinpoint the location of the leak.\n\n**Important Note:** While a small EVAP leak might not immediately impact vehicle performance, it will cause the check engine light to illuminate and could cause the vehicle to fail an emissions test. Ignoring the problem can also potentially lead to increased fuel consumption over time.\n", "vehicle": {"year": 2020, "make": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "engine": null, "vin": null, "mileage": null}, "scan_data": {"dtcs": [{"code": "P0442", "status": "unknown"}], "pids": {}, "freeze_frame": {}}, "mitchell_data": null, "source": "user_chat", "quality_score": null}

I'm Aurora. It looks like you've got a classic \"lean-induced misfire\" scenario on this Accord 2.0T.\n\nA total fuel trim of **+33%** (STFT + LTFT) is a massive correction. Your ECM is screaming for more fuel because it perceives an extreme excess of oxygen in the exhaust. This lean condition is almost certainly what's causing your P0300 random misfire; there simply isn't enough fuel in the cylinders to support consistent combustion.\n\nSince this is a 2.0T (Turbocharged/Direct Injected), we have a few specific areas to investigate. Here is my diagnostic reasoning and recommended path forward:\n\n### 1. The \"Idle vs. Load\" Test (Identify the Source)\nBefore pulling anything apart, look at your fuel trims while holding the engine at roughly 2,500 RPM.\n*   **If trims improve (drop toward 0%):** This points toward a **vacuum leak**. At idle, vacuum is highest and the leaked air represents a large percentage of the total air entering the engine. At higher RPMs, the leak becomes a negligible percentage of the total airflow.\n*   **If trims stay high or get worse:** This points toward a **fuel delivery issue** (fuel pump/injectors) or a **skewed MAF sensor**.\n\n### 2. Inspect the Intake Tract (Common on 2.0T)\nOn these Honda turbo engines, the piping between the MAF sensor and the turbocharger, as well as the charge pipes leading to the intercooler, are critical.\n*   **Check the Boot:** Inspect the rubber intake boot after the MAF sensor. If there is a crack or if a clamp has vibrated loose, \"unmetered\" air is entering the system. The MAF doesn't see it, but the O2 sensor does.\n*   **Intercooler Piping:** Look for oil residue or loose connections on the charge pipes. While these usually cause issues under boost (rich condition), a leak here can still affect idle trims.\n\n### 3. Check the EVAP Purge Valve\nA very common failure point that causes a P0171 and rough idle is a purge valve that is stuck slightly open.\n*   **The Test:** Disconnect the vacuum line from the purge solenoid that leads to the intake manifold and cap the port on the manifold. If your fuel trims immediately start dropping back toward 0%, the purge valve is leaking vacuum from the gas tank and needs replacement.\n\n### 4. High-Pressure Fuel System (Direct Injection)\nSince this is a Direct Injection (DI) engine, fuel pressure is critical.\n*   **Monitor HPFP Pressure:** Use your scan tool to look at the **High-Pressure Fuel Rail** PID. Compare the \"Desired\" vs. \"Actual\" pressure. If the High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) is failing or the camshaft lobe driving it is worn, the engine won't get enough fuel under load, though this usually shows up more during acceleration than at idle.\n\n### 5. MAF Sensor Integrity\nYour MAF reading of **3.2 g/s** at 650 RPM is actually a little high for a 2.0L engine (usually we expect 2.0\u20132.5 g/s). This might be because the engine is struggling to stay running and the IAC/Throttle Plate is opening further to compensate for the rough idle. \n*   **Action:** Inspect the MAF sensor wires for \"fuzz\" or debris. Use a dedicated MAF cleaner if any contamination is found.\n\n### Logical Sequence:\n1.  **Perform the 2,500 RPM trim test** to confirm if it's a vacuum leak.\n2.  **Smoke test the intake system** or use a chemical (like brake cleaner or propane) around the intake manifold gaskets and vacuum lines to see if the RPM/O2 sensor reacts.\n3.  **Pin it/Cap it:** Block off the EVAP purge line to rule out the solenoid.\n4.  **Check fuel pressure specs:** Verify the fuel rail pressure is meeting the target commanded by the ECM.\n\n**Safety Note:** When checking for vacuum leaks with flammable sprays, keep a fire extinguisher nearby and avoid ignition components. Since this is a turbo engine, ensure all clamps are torqued to spec\u2014verify those specific values in your service data.\n\nWhat do the fuel trims do when you bring the RPM up to 2,500?

Here is the breakdown of what this code means and how to approach the repair.\n\n### 1. Issue Summary\nDTC **P0208** stands for **Injector Circuit Malfunction \u2013 Cylinder 8**. This code triggers when the Engine Control Module (ECM) or Powertrain Control Module (PCM) detects a fault in the electrical circuit that controls the fuel injector for the eighth cylinder.\n\n### 2. Diagnostic Reasoning\n1.  **Circuit Continuity:** The PCM monitors the voltage on the injector driver circuit. When the driver is off, it expects to see battery voltage (pulled through the injector coil). When the driver is on (grounded), it expects to see near-zero voltage. If the PCM sees an unexpected voltage state, it sets P0208.\n2.  **Electrical vs. Mechanical:** Unlike a misfire code (P0308), which can be caused by spark or compression, P0208 is strictly an electrical circuit code. The problem is either in the injector solenoid itself, the wiring harness, or the PCM driver.\n3.  **Affected Systems:** This is a fuel delivery circuit issue. If the circuit is open or shorted, cylinder 8 will not receive fuel, leading to a dead misfire and potential lean conditions.\n\n### 3. Test Sequence\n1.  **Visual Inspection:** Check the connector at injector #8. Look for backed-out pins, corrosion, or signs of rodent damage to the wiring harness.\n2.  **Resistance Test (Ohm Check):** Disconnect the injector and measure the resistance across the injector pins. Most injectors typically fall between 11\u201318 ohms, but verify against service data for this specific engine. An \"OL\" (open) reading means the injector coil is dead.\n3.  **Circuit Power Check:** With the key on, engine off (KOEO), use a test light or multimeter to verify that one side of the injector connector has battery voltage (12V).\n4.  **Noid Light Test:** Connect a noid light to the injector harness and crank/run the engine. If the light flashes, the PCM is successfully pulse-width modulating (PWM) the ground side. If it doesn't flash, there is a break in the ground wire or a failed PCM driver.\n5.  **Harness Continuity:** If the injector and power are good, check continuity on the signal wire between the injector connector and the PCM.\n\n### 4. Safety Notes\n*   **Fuel Pressure:** The fuel system is under high pressure. Do not disconnect fuel lines while the engine is hot or without bleeding off pressure.\n*   **Electrical Arcing:** Ensure all connections are secure before starting the engine to prevent sparks near the fuel rail.\n\n### 5.

Additional diagnostic tests recommended._\n\n### Diagnostic Reasoning\nThe combination of P0171 (Lean) and P0300 (Random Misfire) with high positive fuel trims (+33% total fuel correction) strongly points toward an unmetered air leak or a fuel delivery deficiency. \n\n1.  **Fuel Trim Analysis:** Your STFT (+18%) and LTFT (+15%) indicate the ECU is adding a significant amount of fuel to compensate for an over-abundance of air (or lack of fuel). \n2.  **Vacuum Leak vs. MAF/Fuel:** Since the vehicle is a 2.0T (Turbocharged), vacuum leaks often manifest most severely at idle when intake vacuum is highest. If the trims improve as you increase RPM (and decrease vacuum), it confirms a vacuum leak. If trims stay high or worsen at load, we look toward the MAF or fuel pump.\n3.  **Sensor Data:** The O2 sensor at 0.1V confirms a lean condition is actually occurring, meaning the sensor is likely reporting correctly and the engine is physically starved for fuel relative to the air entering the cylinders.\n\n### Test Sequence\n1.  **Trim Check at RPM:** Hold the engine at 2,500 RPM and monitor STFT. If the trim drops significantly (closer to 0%), you have a vacuum leak. If it stays high, suspect a MAF sensor or fuel pressure issue.\n2.  **Smoke Test:** Given this is a turbocharged engine, check all charge pipes, the intercooler, and the intake manifold for leaks. A leak in the \"post-turbo\" section can cause a lean condition at idle but a rich condition under boost (as air escapes).\n3.  **Brake Booster/EVAP Check:** Temporarily pinch off the vacuum lines to the brake booster and the EVAP purge valve. If fuel trims drop, the leak is internal to that component.\n4.  **MAF Inspection:** Check for debris or \"fuzz\" on the MAF sensor wires. Use dedicated MAF cleaner only.\n\n### Safety Notes\n*   **Turbo Heat:** The 2.0T engine bay stays extremely hot. Ensure the vehicle has cooled before reaching near the turbocharger or exhaust manifold.\n*   **Fuel Pressure:** This engine uses Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI). The high-pressure fuel side can reach over 2,000 psi. Do not crack high-pressure fuel lines while the system is pressurized.\n\nDoes the rough idle get better or worse when you increase the engine speed to 2,500 RPM?", "vehicle": {"year": 2018, "make": "Honda", "model": "Accord 2", "engine": null, "vin": null, "mileage": null}, "scan_data": {"dtcs": [{"code": "P0300", "status": "unknown"}, {"code": "P0171", "status": "unknown"}], "pids": {"stft1": 18.0, "ltft1": 15.0}, "freeze_frame": {}}, "mitchell_data": null, "source": "user_chat", "quality_score": null}

Additional diagnostic tests recommended._\n\n### Diagnostic Reasoning:\n1.  **Symptom Analysis:** The combination of P0300 (Random Misfire) and P0171 (Lean Bank 1) indicates that the misfire is likely a *result* of a lean condition rather than an ignition failure. A lean mixture (too much air or not enough fuel) is harder to ignite, causing the rough idle and hesitation.\n2.  **Fuel Trim Interpretation:** Your Total Fuel Trim (Short Term + Long Term) is +33%. This is a massive correction. Since the ECM is adding fuel to compensate for excess air, we look for sources of unmetered air or low fuel delivery.\n3.  **Vacuum Leak vs. Fuel Delivery:** Typically, a vacuum leak has the greatest impact at idle (high vacuum, low air volume) and improves at higher RPMs. If the fuel trims improve (decrease) when you hold the engine at 2,500 RPM, it confirms a vacuum leak. If trims stay high or get worse at high RPM, it points toward a fuel delivery issue (weak pump/clogged injectors) or a skewed MAF sensor.\n4.  **PID Analysis:** The O2 sensor at 0.1V confirms the engine is physically running lean; the sensor is not \"lying\" to the computer. The MAF reading of 3.2 g/s is within a typical range for a 2.0L engine at idle, but if there is a leak *after* the MAF, that air isn't being measured.\n\n### Test Sequence:\n1.  **Propane/Carb Cleaner Test:** While monitoring Short Term Fuel Trim (STFT) at idle, carefully spray a combustible around the intake manifold gaskets and vacuum lines. If the STFT drops sharply into the negative, you\u2019ve found your leak.\n2.  **Brake Booster Check:** Pinch off the vacuum supply line to the brake booster. If the idle smooths out and fuel trims drop, the booster diaphragm is leaking.\n3.  **High RPM Trim Test:** Increase engine speed to 2,500 RPM and hold. If STFT drops significantly (e.g., from +18% down to +5%), focus entirely on a vacuum leak.\n4.  **Fuel Pressure Test:** If trims remain high at 2,500 RPM, verify the high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP) and low-pressure supply pump are meeting commanded targets.\n\n### Safety Notes:\n*   **Turbocharger Heat:** On the 2.0T, the turbocharger and exhaust components stay extremely hot. Use caution when searching for vacuum leaks near the back of the engine.\n*   **Flammables:** If using carb cleaner to find a leak, keep a fire extinguisher nearby and avoid spraying near ignition coils or cracked spark plug boots to prevent fire.\n\n**Next Question:** When you increase the RPM to 2,500, do the Short Term Fuel Trims stay high, or do they move closer to 0%?", "vehicle": {"year": 2018, "make": "Honda", "model": "Accord 2", "engine": null, "vin": null, "mileage": null}, "scan_data": {"dtcs": [{"code": "P0300", "status": "unknown"}, {"code": "P0171", "status": "unknown"}], "pids": {"stft1": 18.0, "ltft1": 15.0}, "freeze_frame": {}}, "mitchell_data": null, "source": "user_chat", "quality_score": null}

Additional diagnostic tests recommended._\n\n### Diagnostic Reasoning:\n1.  **Code Definition:** P0443 is a \"Circuit\" code. This means the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is monitoring the electrical integrity of the purge solenoid circuit. It expects to see a specific voltage/current when the solenoid is commanded ON and OFF. If it sees an open circuit or a short, it triggers this code.\n2.  **Part Replacement Logic:** Replacing the solenoid was a logical first step, but since the code remains, the problem exists in the wiring harness between the solenoid and the PCM, the power supply to the solenoid, or the PCM driver itself.\n3.  **Circuit Operation:** Typically, one wire at the solenoid provides 12V (B+) whenever the ignition is on, and the PCM provides a \"Ground Side\" pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal on the second wire to control the valve.\n\n### Action Steps:\n1.  **Check Power Supply:** Use a multimeter or test light at the purge valve connector. With the key in the ON position, check for 12V power on the supply wire. If there is no power, check for a blown fuse or a break in the power distribution circuit.\n2.  **Inspect Connector Pins:** Closely examine the harness connector for \"green crusties\" (corrosion) or \"spread terminals\" (pins that aren't making tight contact).\n3.  **Test Control Side (Ground):** Using a test light connected to Battery Positive, probe the control wire while using a scan tool to \"Command\" the purge solenoid ON. If the light doesn't blink or turn on, there is an open in the wire back to the PCM.\n4.  **Continuity Test:** Disconnect the PCM and the purge solenoid. Measure resistance (Ohms) on both wires. Resistance should be very low (typically less than 1 Ohm). If it's \"OL\" (Open Loop), you have a broken wire.\n\n### Specs:\nThe purge solenoid typically operates on a 12V system. Resistance for a new solenoid varies by manufacturer, but the circuit should show battery voltage on the feed side with the key on. Consult your service data for exact pin locations at the PCM.\n\n### Images:\nNone available\n\n### Verification:\nClear the DTCs and perform an \"Output Test\" or \"Actuator Test\" using a scan tool to command the purge valve.

Additional diagnostic tests recommended._\n\n### Diagnostic Reasoning:\n1.  **Code Definition:** P0443 specifically refers to a \"Purge Control Valve Circuit Malfunction.\" This is a purely electrical code. The Engine Control Module (ECM) monitors the voltage on the purge valve control circuit; if it doesn't see the expected voltage drop when it commands the valve on, or if it sees a short to ground/power, it sets this code.\n2.  **Component vs. Circuit:** Replacing the valve didn't fix it because the fault likely lies in the wiring harness, a blown fuse, or the ECM driver itself.\n3.  **Circuit Logic:** The purge valve is typically supplied with 12V (B+) whenever the ignition is on. The ECM provides the ground path (Pulse Width Modulation) to activate the valve. If the 12V supply is missing, the ECM will flag a circuit fault.\n\n### Test Sequence:\n1.  **Check Power Supply:** Disconnect the purge valve connector.

This means the PCM (Engine Computer) has detected an electrical issue with the circuit\u2014either an open circuit, a short to ground, or a short to voltage. Since you have already replaced the valve and the code returned, the problem is almost certainly in the wiring harness or the PCM itself, not the valve.\n2. **Power Supply:** The purge solenoid typically receives a constant 12V power supply when the ignition is on (often shared with other emissions components). If this fuse is blown or a wire is broken, the circuit is \"open.\"\n3. **Control Side:** The PCM controls the purge valve by \"pulsing\" the ground side of the circuit. If the ground wire is chafed and touching the chassis, the valve will stay wide open; if the wire is broken, it will never purge.\n4. **Data Verification:** Based on my verified data sources, P0443 is strictly a circuit code. The \"Low Confidence\" report from the tool likely stems from the fact that it is an electrical fault that requires manual pinpoint testing rather than a sensor logic failure.\n\n### Action Steps:\n1. **Check the Fuse:** Locating the fuse that powers the EVAP Purge Solenoid. If it is blown, the solenoid can't operate.\n2. **Verify Power at the Connector:** Unplug the purge valve. With the key in the \"ON\" position (engine off), use a multimeter to check for 12V on one of the pins. \n3. **Check Control Circuit (Ground):** Using a test light connected to battery positive, touch the other pin at the connector while using a scan tool to \"command\" the purge solenoid on. If the light doesn't blink or stay steady when commanded, there is a break in the wire between the solenoid and the PCM.\n4. **Inspect Wiring Harness:** On these models, check the wiring near the loom for evidence of rodent damage or chafing against the engine block.\n\n### Specs:\nThe circuit should typically show battery voltage (approx. 12.6V) at the power side with the key on. Resistance of the solenoid itself varies, but the code persists with a new part, suggesting the vehicle-side wiring is the focus. Verify exact pinouts with your service data.\n\n### Images:\nNone available\n\n### Verification:\nClear the DTCs after repairs. Perform a \"Purge/Seal\" service test with a scan tool or drive the vehicle through a complete warm-up cycle.

Additional diagnostic tests recommended._\n\n### Diagnostic Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Code Definition:** P0443 stands for **EVAP Purge Control Valve Circuit Malfunction**. This is specifically an electrical circuit code. The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) monitors the voltage on the purge valve circuit; if it sees a voltage that doesn't match the commanded state (e.g., it commands it ON but the circuit stays high), it triggers this code.\n2.  **Replacement Failure:** Since you have already replaced the solenoid and the code remains, we can effectively rule out the component itself. The fault lies in the **wiring harness, the connector, or the PCM driver**.\n3.  **Circuit Logic:** The purge valve typically receives a constant 12V power supply from a fuse or relay when the ignition is on. The PCM then provides a \"Pulse Width Modulated\" (PWM) ground to actuate the valve. A break in the power wire, a break in the control wire to the PCM, or a short to ground will cause P0443.\n\n### Test Sequence:\n\n1.  **Check Power Supply:** Unplug the purge valve connector. With the key in the \"ON\" position (engine off), use a multimeter or test light to check for 12V on the power pin of the connector. \n    *   *If no power:* Check the fuse related to the EVAP system/Engine sensors (consult your fuse box diagram).\n2.  **Inspect Connector:** Look closely at the pins inside the harness connector for \"green crusties\" (corrosion) or pins that have been pushed back. 2014 Jeeps can suffer from wire fatigue near the connector due to engine vibration.\n3.  **Check Control Side Continuity:** Using a multimeter set to Ohms, check for continuity on the control (ground) wire from the purge valve connector back to the appropriate pin at the PCM. \n    *   *Note:* You will need a wiring diagram to identify the specific PCM pin.\n4.  **Short to Ground Test:** With the PCM and Solenoid unplugged, check if the control wire has continuity to the chassis. If it does, the wire is pinched and shorting to ground.\n\n### Safety Notes:\n*   **Battery Safety:** When unplugging PCM connectors, ensure the battery is disconnected to prevent accidental voltage spikes.\n*   **Backprobing:** Do not shove multimeter leads into the front of the weather-sealed connectors; this can \"spread\" the terminals and create a new intermittent connection problem.

Inspect the connector for pushed-out pins, corrosion, or wiring damage (chafing) between the solenoid and the PCM.\n3. **Verify Power and Ground:** Use a digital multimeter or test light to verify that 12V is present at the solenoid connector with the key on.\n4. **Test PCM Control:** The PCM controls the solenoid by pulsing the ground side.

This is strictly an electrical code. The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) monitors the voltage on the purge valve circuit. If it expects to see 12V and sees 0V (or vice versa), it triggers this code.\n2.  **Part Replacement vs. Circuit Testing:** Replacing the solenoid was a logical first step, but since the code remains, the issue is not the \"load\" (the valve) but the \"delivery\" (the wiring or power supply).\n3.  **Circuit Logic:** The purge valve is a two-wire solenoid. One wire should have constant battery voltage (12V) when the ignition is on (usually supplied via a fuse/relay). The second wire is the \"ground side control\" wire that runs back to the PCM. The PCM toggles this wire to ground to open the valve. \n4.  **Likely Failure Points:** Since the valve is new, we are looking for a blown fuse, a broken wire in the harness (very common on Jeeps near the battery or TIPM), or a failed driver inside the PCM.\n\n### Test Sequence:\n1.  **Check Power Supply:** Unplug the purge valve connector. With the ignition in the \"ON\" position (engine off), use a multimeter or test light to check for 12V on one of the pins. \n    *   *If 12V is missing:* You have a blown fuse or a broken power wire. Check your fuse box (TIPM) for any blown \"Engine\" or \"EMS\" fuses.\n2.  **Test Control Side:** Connect a test light to the battery positive (+) terminal and touch the other end to the *control* pin of the connector (the one that didn't have 12V). Use a scan tool to perform a \"Purge Solenoid Functional Test\" or \"Actuator Test.\" \n    *   *If the light flashes or turns on:* The PCM and wiring are good; the new valve might be faulty.\n    *   *If the light never turns on:* There is an open circuit in the wire between the solenoid and the PCM, or the PCM driver has failed.\n3.  **Harness Inspection:** Trace the wiring harness from the purge valve back toward the main loom. Look for green crusty corrosion (wire rot) or spots where the harness may have rubbed against the frame or engine.\n4.  **Continuity Test:** If you have a wiring diagram, check for continuity (ohms) between the solenoid connector's control pin and the corresponding pin at the PCM connector. It should be less than 5 ohms.\n\n### Safety Notes:\n*   **Electrical Shorting:** Never \"probe\" the PCM pins directly with a thick multimeter lead, as you can spread the terminals and cause a permanent poor connection. Use back-probe pins or a proper breakout kit.\n*   **TIPM Caution:** On 2014 Jeeps, the Totally Integrated Power Module (TIPM) is sensitive.

Unlike \"leak\" codes (P0442, P0455), this code is triggered when the PCM detects an electrical abnormality (incorrect voltage or resistance) on the purge valve circuit itself.\n2.  **Part Replacement Failure:** Since you have already replaced the solenoid and the code remains, we can effectively rule out the solenoid coil. The problem lies in the \"delivery\" system: the power supply, the ground control wire, or the PCM driver.\n3.  **Circuit Logic:** Most Chrysler/Jeep purge valves receive a constant 12V feed from a fuse or relay when the ignition is on. The PCM then pulses the ground side to \"duty cycle\" the valve. A break in either of these wires, or a short to ground, will trigger P0443 instantly.\n\n**SUMMARY:**\nThe P0443 code indicates an electrical circuit failure; since the valve is new, the issue is likely a broken wire, a corroded connector, or a blown fuse.\n\n**ACTION STEPS:**\n1.  **Check Power Supply:** Unplug the purge valve connector. With the ignition in the \"ON\" position (engine off), use a multimeter to check for 12V at one of the pins. \n2.  **Inspect Connector:** Look for \"green crusties\" (corrosion) or backed-out pins inside the connector you just unplugged.\n3.  **Test PCM Control:** Using a test light connected to battery positive, touch the other pin of the connector while using a scan tool to command the Purge Solenoid \"ON.\" The light should blink or glow.\n4.  **Verify Fuse:** Check the fuse box for any blown fuses related to the powertrain or emissions (often labeled \"ENG\" or \"ASD\").\n\n**SPECS:**\n- **Voltage:** Typically 12V (battery voltage) at the power feed pin with ignition ON.\n- **Resistance:** A new solenoid typically measures between 10\u201330 ohms (verify with service data, but an \"open\" reading indicates a bad part).\n\n**IMAGES:**\nNone available\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\nClear the DTCs using a scan tool. Start the engine and monitor the EVAP Purge Command percentage. If the circuit is repaired, the P0443 should stay in \"Pending\" or \"Stored\" and not return to \"Active\" status immediately upon startup.\n\n---\n**Next Question:** Do you have a multimeter or a test light available to check for 12V power at the purge valve connector?", "vehicle": {"year": 2018, "make": "Honda", "model": "Accord 2", "engine": null, "vin": null, "mileage": null}, "scan_data": {"dtcs": [{"code": "P0443", "status": "unknown"}], "pids": {}, "freeze_frame": {}}, "mitchell_data": null, "source": "user_chat", "quality_score": null}

Additional diagnostic tests recommended._\n\n### Diagnostic Reasoning:\n1.  **Circuit Logic:** P0443 is a \"Circuit\" code, not a \"Performance\" code. This means the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is detecting an electrical issue (open circuit, short to ground, or short to voltage) in the purge solenoid's wiring or the solenoid's internal coil. Replacing the part didn't fix it because the fault is likely in the wiring or the connector.\n2.  **Power vs. Ground:** On this Jeep, the solenoid typically receives a constant 12V power source (often shared with other sensors), and the PCM provides a \"Pulse Width Modulated\" (PWM) ground to command the valve open. If that power is missing or the ground wire is chafed/broken, the code will set immediately.\n3.  **Verification of Part:** Even new parts can be DOA (Dead On Arrival). We must verify the new solenoid's resistance is within a typical range (usually 15-30 ohms, though you should check service data) to rule it out.\n\n### Test Sequence:\n1.  **Check Power:** With the key in the \"ON\" position (engine off), use a multimeter to check for 12V at the purge solenoid connector. If you have 0V, check the relevant fuses in the Power Distribution Center (PDC).\n2.  **Circuit Continuity:** Check the ground side of the connector (the control wire) for continuity back to the PCM. A break in this wire is common near the connector or at high-flex points in the harness.\n3.  **Load Test:** Use a test light connected to battery positive and touch it to the control wire while using a scan tool to command the purge solenoid \"ON.\" If the light doesn't pulse/brighten, the PCM isn't grounding the circuit or the wire is broken.\n4.  **Inspect Connector:** Look for \"pin fitment\" issues. Ensure the terminals inside the plug aren't spread too wide to make contact with the solenoid pins.\n\n### Safety Notes:\n*   **PCM Protection:** Never probe PCM wires with a standard test light unless you are sure it is a high-impedance LED type; a standard incandescent bulb can draw too much current and damage the PCM driver.\n*   **Fuel Vapors:** Work in a well-ventilated area, as you are working around the evaporative system which contains fuel vapors.\n\n**Next Question:** Do you have a multimeter or a test light available, and are you able to command the solenoid \"ON\" using a scan tool?", "vehicle": {"year": 2018, "make": "Honda", "model": "Accord 2", "engine": null, "vin": null, "mileage": null}, "scan_data": {"dtcs": [{"code": "P0443", "status": "unknown"}], "pids": {}, "freeze_frame": {}}, "mitchell_data": null, "source": "user_chat", "quality_score": null}

I have replaced purge valve solenoid and the codes are still present. What can you do to help me to fix this problem?", "output_text": "I could not find a specific diagnostic path for the 2014 Jeep Compass in my verified data sources. Based on my general knowledge as a diagnostic expert, here is the analysis and logical progression for a persistent P0443.\n\n**SUMMARY:**\nThe P0443 code indicates an electrical circuit malfunction in the Evaporative Emission (EVAP) Purge Control Valve circuit. Since the valve has already been replaced, the issue lies within the power supply, the wiring to the PCM, or the PCM's internal driver.\n\n**ACTION STEPS:**\n1. **Check the Fuse:** Locating the fuse that powers the EVAP purge solenoid is the first step. On many Jeeps, this is shared with other emissions components (like O2 sensor heaters). If the fuse is blown, the solenoid will never receive the 12V it needs to operate.\n2. **Test for Power:** Disconnect the purge solenoid. With the Key On, Engine Off (KOEO), use a Multimeter or Test Light to check for 12V at one of the pins on the harness connector. \n    * *If no power:* There is an open in the power feed wire or a blown fuse.\n3. **Test the Control Side:** The PCM controls the solenoid by providing a \"Ground.\" Using a scan tool with bi-directional controls, command the Purge Solenoid \"ON.\" Use a test light connected to Battery Positive (+) and touch the other end to the control pin on the harness. The light should illuminate when commanded on.\n4. **Inspect Wiring Harness:** Check the wiring near the solenoid and along the firewall. These wires are often exposed to heat and vibration, which can cause chafing or breaks.\n5. **Check Resistance:** Measure the resistance of the *new* solenoid. While it is new, \"out of the box\" failures do happen. It should typically show a specific resistance range (usually between 10\u201330 ohms, but verify with service data).\n\n**SPECS:**\n* **Voltage:** Should be battery voltage (approx. 12.6V KOEO) at the power pin.\n* **Resistance:** Typically 10\u201330 ohms for the solenoid, though this varies. Check your service data for the exact specification for a 2014 Jeep Compass.\n* **Circuit Continuity:** Resistance from the solenoid connector back to the PCM pin should be less than 5.0 ohms.\n\n**IMAGES:**\nNone available\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\nAfter performing repairs or finding a wiring fault, clear the DTCs with a scan tool. Perform an \"EVAP Service Test\" if your scan tool supports it, or drive the vehicle through a complete drive cycle. If the electrical circuit is intact, the P0443 will not return immediately upon key cycle or solenoid command.\n\n**Diagnostic Reasoning:**\nIt's important to understand that P0443 is a **circuit code**, not a **flow code** (like P0441). The PCM is not looking at whether the valve is actually moving air; it is monitoring the voltage on the control wire. \n* When the solenoid is **OFF**, the PCM expects to see 12V on the control wire (sensing power *through* the solenoid coil).\n* When the solenoid is **ON**, the PCM expects to see the voltage drop near 0V as it pulls the circuit to ground.\nIf the PCM doesn't see these specific voltage changes, it triggers P0443. Since you replaced the valve, the \"coil\" part of that equation is likely fine, leaving only the \"power in\" or \"ground out\" sections of the circuit as the culprits.\n\n**Next Question:** Do you have a digital multimeter or a scan tool with bi-directional controls to test the circuit's response?", "vehicle": {"year": 2018, "make": "Honda", "model": "Accord 2", "engine": null, "vin": null, "mileage": null}, "scan_data": {"dtcs": [{"code": "P0443", "status": "unknown"}], "pids": {}, "freeze_frame": {}}, "mitchell_data": null, "source": "user_chat", "quality_score": null}

Additional diagnostic tests recommended._\n\n### Diagnostic Reasoning:\n1.  **Code Definition:** P0443 stands for \"Evaporative Emission System Purge Control Valve Circuit Malfunction.\" The PCM monitors the voltage on the control circuit. If it commands the valve ON and doesn't see the expected voltage drop, or commands it OFF and sees incorrect voltage, it sets this code.\n2.  **Circuit Logic:** The purge solenoid is typically a two-wire component. One wire provides 12V power (usually from a relay or fuse), and the other is a ground-side control wire handled by the PCM.\n3.  **Why the new part didn't fix it:** Since the code returned, the issue is likely not the solenoid itself. It is almost certainly a break in the wiring, a blown fuse, or a failed driver inside the PCM.\n4.  **Verification of Power:** If the solenoid isn't getting 12V from the battery/fuse, the PCM will see an \"open circuit\" and trigger P0443 immediately upon startup.\n\n### Test Sequence:\n1.  **Check Power at Connector:** Unplug the purge solenoid. With the key in the ON position (engine off), use a multimeter to check for 12V on one of the pins. \n    *   *If no voltage:* Check the fuse box for a blown fuse related to \"Engine\" or \"EVAP.\"\n2.  **Check Continuity to PCM:** If you have 12V, the problem is likely on the control side. You will need to check continuity (ohms) on the second wire from the solenoid connector back to the PCM connector. \n    *   *Note:* Look for green crusty corrosion inside the connector terminals.\n3.  **Load Test the Circuit:** Use a test light connected to battery positive and touch the control wire pin at the solenoid connector while using a scan tool to command the purge valve \"ON.\" If the light doesn't blink or shine, the PCM is not grounding the circuit.\n4.  **Solenoid Resistance:** Even though it's new, verify the resistance of the solenoid. Most purge valves are typically between 10-30 ohms, but check your service data for the exact range.\n\n### Safety Notes:\n*   **Backprobing:** Avoid shoving multimeter probes directly into the front of the connector terminals, as this can spread the \"tongues\" and cause a permanent loose connection. Use backprobes or a proper terminal test kit.\n*   **PCM Safety:** Never apply 12V directly to the control wire while it is connected to the PCM, as you could fry the internal driver.\n\n**Next Question:** Do you have a multimeter or a test light available to check for power at the purge valve connector?", "vehicle": {"year": 2018, "make": "Honda", "model": "Accord 2", "engine": null, "vin": null, "mileage": null}, "scan_data": {"dtcs": [{"code": "P0443", "status": "unknown"}], "pids": {}, "freeze_frame": {}}, "mitchell_data": null, "source": "user_chat", "quality_score": null}
